          <p>I hope you are excited about writing your first code as much as I was. "Hello World" is often the first program many developers write, as it was for me. Seeing the two words on the screen means that your code can compile, load, run, and produce the output. I welcome you to the world of programming and the incredible journey that lies ahead of you, given you stick to the path.</p>
          <p>Starting with HTML, and CSS, and moving onto the cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language known as JavaScript for front-end developers, the coding journey is sure to be an exciting one. Then there is Python, Java, Ruby on Rails for back-end development. If you are interested in mobile development, you will need languages such as C++, C#, and SQL. Whichever path to web development you choose, the journey is ultimately what matters and that you enjoy the process.</p>
        <li>Programming languages come in two forms: low-level and high-level languages. Low-level programming languages, or binary code, look like a sequence of "1s" and "0s". Computers understand low-level programming code and can process it quicker.</li>
        <li>Programmers, on the other hand, can learn and use high-level programming languages faster since it looks like a human language.</li>

          <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the fundamental foundation of the Web, establishing the meaning and organization of web content. While HTML outlines the content's structure, other technologies such as CSS are used to define its appearance, and JavaScript adds functionality and behavior to web pages.</p>
          <p>"Hypertext" pertains to the links that connect web pages, whether within the same site or across different websites. These links are a crucial component of the Web. By publishing content online and linking it to other pages created by different users, you actively contribute to the World Wide Web.</p>
          <p>HTML employs "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for rendering in a web browser. This markup consists of specific "elements".</p>
          <li>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture.</li>
          <li>HTML is not a programming language. The "M" in HTML stands for "Markup." Unlike programming languages, which describe processes and algorithms, HTML is used to provide context and structure to text.</li>
          <code>Writing "Hello World" in HTML can be simple as writing out the words themselves. However normally they would be enclosed within tags <  > such as h1 or p.</code>

          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language designed to dictate how a document written in HTML or XML should be presented. CSS defines the visual appearance of elements, specifying how they should be displayed on screens, printed on paper, read aloud, or shown on other media.</p>
          <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is employed to style and layout web pages. It allows you to modify aspects such as font, color, size, and spacing of content, create multi-column layouts, and incorporate animations and decorative elements. This module offers an introductory guide to CSS, covering the fundamentals of how it functions, its syntax, and how you can begin applying it to style HTML content.</p>
          <li>CSS was initially proposed in 1994 by Håkon Wium Lie while he was working at CERN with computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
          <li>CSS can be implemented in three distinct ways within HTML documents:</li>
          <code>Inline CSS: Directly applies styles to individual HTML elements using the <i>style</i> attribute. This method is suitable for single-element styling. 
            ie. 
            <.h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading<./h1> 
            <.p style="color:red;">A red paragraph<./p></code>
          <code>Internal CSS: Involves embedding CSS within the <b>style</b> element in the head section of an HTML page. This approach is ideal for styling that's specific to a single page. 
            ie. 
            <.style> 
              body { 
              background-color: green; 
            } 
              h1 { 
              color: blue; 
            } 
              p { 
              color: red; 
            } 
            <./style></code>
          <code>External CSS: Links to an external .css file using the <b>link</b> element, allowing for consistent styling across multiple pages. This method promotes maintainability and reusability. 
            ie. 
            <.link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> 
            <br>
            <b><i>NOTE* Remove . by opening & closing tags for the code to work</i></b></code>

          <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. It powers interactive elements on web pages, making it a crucial component of web applications. Most websites rely on JavaScript, and all major web browsers include dedicated engines to execute it.</p>
          <p>JavaScript is a scripting and programming language that enables the implementation of complex features on web pages. Whenever a web page goes beyond simply displaying static information—such as showing real-time content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video playlists—JavaScript is likely playing a key role.</p>
          <li>JavaScript operates in a single-threaded manner, which is why some users familiar with multi-threaded programming might find it slower. This limitation means that JavaScript cannot fully utilize all the CPU cores, potentially affecting its performance.</li>
          <li>Although JavaScript and Java share some similarities, such as their names, standard libraries, and syntax, they are fundamentally different languages with distinct designs.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is the most widely used scripting language on earth. JavaScript is supported by all modern Web browsers with the built-in interpreters.</li>
          <code>console.log('Hello World');</code>

          <p>Web development has become increasingly popular in recent years. The reason for this surge in interest is clear: web development encompasses the creation and upkeep of websites, ensuring they look appealing, function smoothly, and provide a seamless user experience. It's all about making websites attractive, responsive, and high-performing.</p>
          <p>Web developers use various languages depending on the tasks at hand. The high demand for web development is largely driven by its lucrative pay scale worldwide and the fact that it does not necessarily require a university degree to demonstrate qualifications. Web development is typically divided into two main areas: Front-end and Back-end. Front-end development focuses on the elements users interact with directly, while back-end development handles server-related operations and data management.</p>
          <p>Web development utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and visually appealing websites. Compared to software or Android app development, web development is often simpler because web technologies are more uniform. In contrast, native app development requires coding specifically for each platform, which involves different languages and processes, demanding additional resources and expertise.</p>
          <p>To be a successful web developer, one must possess a blend of technical skills and creativity. Key qualities include a strong understanding of responsive design principles and a knack for problem-solving. Attention to detail and the ability to adapt to new technologies are crucial. Effective communication and teamwork are also important, as web developers often collaborate with designers and clients to create functional and visually appealing websites. A passion for continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends is essential for long-term success in this dynamic field.</p>
